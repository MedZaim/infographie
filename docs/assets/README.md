# Screenshots assets

Place your screenshots in this folder so they can be referenced from the root README.

Currently referenced by README:
- infographie_UI_Launcher.png — capture of the Qt UI launcher showing the grid of sample buttons.
- hello_graphics.png — the window produced by the "Hello Graphics" sample (`aa__hello/hello_graphics.cpp`).

How to update with new images:
- Overwrite the PNG files above with new captures using the same filenames; README will update automatically.
- If you prefer different names or formats (e.g., SVG), add them here and update the image paths in README.md accordingly.

Tips for consistent screenshots:
- Use a neutral desktop/theme with default scaling (100%).
- Width around 1200–1600px displays well on GitHub.
- Prefer lossless formats for crisp UI (PNG/SVG).
