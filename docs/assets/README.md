# Screenshots assets

Place your screenshots in this folder so they can be referenced from the root README.

Currently referenced by README:
- infographie_UI_Launcher.png — capture of the Qt UI launcher showing the grid of sample buttons.
- hello_graphics.png — the window produced by the "Hello Graphics" sample (`aa__hello/hello_graphics.cpp`).

How to update with new images:
- Overwrite the PNG files above with new captures using the same filenames; README will update automatically.
- If you prefer different names or formats (e.g., SVG), add them here and update the image paths in README.md accordingly.

Tips for consistent screenshots:
- Use a neutral desktop/theme with default scaling (100%).
- Width around 1200–1600px displays well on GitHub.
- Prefer lossless formats for crisp UI (PNG/SVG).

## Video

To embed a short demo video in the README:
- Save your clip as `docs/assets/demo.mp4`.
- The README includes an HTML5 player that will appear automatically once this file exists.
- The player uses `docs/assets/hello_graphics.png` as a poster (thumbnail) image.

Notes:
- Keep the file size under 100 MB (GitHub’s standard file limit). For larger videos, consider Git LFS or upload to YouTube and update the link in README.
- Recommended encoding for compatibility: H.264 video (MP4) with AAC audio, ~1080p at a modest bitrate (4–8 Mbps).
- If you use YouTube instead, replace `REPLACE_WITH_VIDEO_ID` in the README with your actual video ID.
